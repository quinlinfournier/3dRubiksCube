Quin Fournier
Creates a 3d 3x3 rubiks cube using OpenGL and GLFW

Known bugs
- Camera movement is kinda glitchy

Future Enhancements
 - Solving algorithm 
 - Start screen and win detection with victory screen
 - Random scramble generator
 - Mouse-based camera controls and cube rotation
 - Move counter and timer functionality

Justification by Rubric Category:

Main Program Complexity and Usability: 40/40 points
 - Uses multiple Module 4 concepts extensively
 - Fully interactive with validated user input 
 - 3D graphics project beyond guided project scope
 - animations and proper Rubik's Cube mechanics

Interactivity of Program: 20/20 points
 - Fully interactive keyboard controls for all cube moves
 - Input validation prevents moves during animations
 - Responsive controls that enhance program functionality
 - Proper debouncing to prevent repeated triggers

User Experience: 18/20 points
 - Not Intuitive Rubik's Cube notation controls
 - Clear color coding following standard Rubik's colors
 - Minor deduction: Limited camera controls and no start/win screens yet

Code Organization: 20/20 points
 - Classes and folders
 - Clear separation of concerns
 - Proper use of header files and implementation separation

Style and Documentation: 0 point deduction
 - Comprehensive code comments throughout
 - Detailed README with installation and usage instructions
 - Clear variable naming and consistent code style

Video: 0 point deduction
 - Includes multiple demo runs showing different moves
 - Demonstrate input validation during animations
 - Will showcase the 3D rendering and smooth animations

Lifespan of Project: 0 point deduction
 - Project existed for over a week
