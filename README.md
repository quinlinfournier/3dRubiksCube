Creates a 3d 3x3 rubiks cube using OpenGL and GLFW

Known bugs
- Camera movement is kinda glitchy

Future Enhancements
 - Solving algorithm 
 - Start screen and win detection with victory screen
 - Random scramble generator
 - Mouse-based camera controls and cube rotation
 - Move counter and timer functionality

Justification by Rubric Category:

Main Program Complexity and Usability: 40/40 points
 - Uses multiple Module 4 concepts extensively
 - Fully interactive with validated user input 
 - 3D graphics project beyond guided project scope
 - animations and proper Rubik's Cube mechanics
================== ADDITION ==================
   I am working on Adding auto solving to the rubiks cube project I how ever was unsuccessful at getting the cube to completely solve

   But i did get it to solve most of the way
   It can create the White Cross: 45 points
   then flips the cube
   It then inserts the four corners  35 points
   It then solves the yellow cross 20
   Then it tries to puts the correct edge piece in the right spot and because of the flip it messes up
   Then it tried to put corners in the right position 10

   Also added debuging through out the entire program

   Time: 50+ hrs 20 pts

   130 Total points
